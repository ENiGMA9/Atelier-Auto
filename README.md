# Atelier Auto
This is a project I made for a **CPP OOP Class** I took in **2016**. It was to learn and implement OOP Concepts. While it is nothing too fancy and to this date I added to my knowledge from back then, I'm quite happy with the usage of **CRTP** (Curiously Recurring Template Pattern)


# How to build
Open the solution with any Visual Studio starting from version **2013**. It was made with **vs120** tools, if you use anything newer you can upgrade, it *probably* won't break.
