# Atelier Auto
This is a project I made for a **CPP OOP Class** I took in **2016**. It was to learn and implement OOP Concepts.


# How to build
Open the solution with any Visual Studio starting from version **2013**. It was made with **vs120** tools, if you use anything newer you can upgrade, it *probably* won't break.
